## ðŸ“‚ `web/` â€” Local Viewer UI

**Purpose:** Minimal UI for browsing recent attestations on the Node device.

**Key files**

* `templates/index.html` â€“ landing page.
* `templates/attestation.html` â€“ single attestation view.
* `static/style.css` â€“ small stylesheet.

**Running**

```bash
python scripts/web.py   # serves on port from .env / config
```

**Notes**

* Keep it lightweight; the Node is offlineâ€‘first and may run on small hardware.
