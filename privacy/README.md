## ðŸ“‚ `privacy/` â€” Consent, Policy, Notices

**Purpose:** Humanâ€‘readable notices that govern how attestations are handled.

**Key files**

* `CONSENT_PROMPT.txt` â€“ the onâ€‘device message read/shown before recording.
* `POLICY.md` â€“ what is stored, what may be displayed, how to request removal/changes (if permitted by policy).

**Operational tips**

* Keep the prompt short; the porch sign echoes the same message.
* Update policy here, then link to it from tickets (QR code or short URL).
